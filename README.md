The Worlds of Legacy SRD is a system reference document that extracts the core mechanics from the post-apocalyptic RPG "Legacy: Life Among the Ruins," allowing players to create games using its unique dual-scale gameplay where each player controls both a group (hundreds of people operating over time) and individual characters from those groups for focused adventures. The system emphasizes collaborative worldbuilding, permanent world changes across generations, and storytelling that spans both intimate character moments and epic group sagas in a dangerous world filled with mysterious technology.

The ideas used in this module are from the [Worlds of Legacy SRD](https://ufopress.co.uk/the-world-of-legacy-srd/)

This module is for [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) and requires the [PbtA System](https://github.com/asacolips-projects/pbta) created by [asacolips](https://github.com/asacolips).
